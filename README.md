Texas Major City Weather Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to view weather information for 3 of Texas' major cities: Austin, Dallas, and Houston. This application uses the  OpenWeatherMapâ€™s API to generate real-time weather information.

How It's Made: Tech used: React, OpenWeatherMap's API, and Bootstrap (for the modal)

Optimizations: I would like to add a search component to this web application to allow users to view weather information for the city of their choice and then display all applicable data. With more time, it would be awesome to add a feature that allows the user to pin or "favorite" the cities of their choice to the web page as well so that they can view the weather data easier.

Lessons Learned: This is my second time using Promise.all ever. Promise.all is a great method for making multiple API requests concurrently. Since JavaScript is synchronous by nature, Promise.all helps with asynchronous operations. One of the benefits of Promise.all is that it simplifies code and resolves only if ALL promises resolve, otherwise it will be rejected. 
One of the resources used to understand Promise.all was: https://blog.logrocket.com/understanding-promise-all-in-javascript/.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
